== INSTALL

Installation is pretty straightforward -- it's a gem now!

$ rvm gem install packetfu

Not using rvm? For shame! Get it now, it will make your life 100x better.

$ links http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/

If you are installing from a source checkout, just run (as root / rvmsudo):

$ rvmsudo ./setup.rb
$ sudo ruby ./setup.rb # If not on rvm, and seriously what is wrong with you?

== Testing

The easiest way to test the installation is to run PacketFu via
irb, using the example shell in the "examples" directory:

% sudo irb -r packetfu-shell.rb

After the banner, you should see something like:

>>> Use $packetfu_default.config for salient networking details.

>>> Packet capturing/injecting enabled.

If not, then Something Went Wrong. It's most likely that you have either
an older or broken version of pcaprub (try installing the version provided
with Metasploit), or you have a very, very old version of libpcap (version
0.9.4 is the oldest tested version, and there's really no reason to not
be at least on 1.0.0).
