TODO for PacketFu

Bugs:

See http://code.google.com/p/packetfu/issues/list

Next major version:

Rewrite TCPOpts to be safe and sane by using BinData structs

Pcapfiles should take and honor usec fields.

Collect Metasploit diffs to incorporate. 

Someday:
Rewrite the whole protocol tree so a simple 'require protocol' is sufficent.

Think about adding taint values to rewritten packets?

--Merge in release version of BinData once readeof-patch is committed to a tagged version--

Fix up setup.rb to prompt for an overwrite of existing BinData and Pcaprub installations.

Create a gem distribution (?? I dunno I still kind of hate gems)
