# Uniqpcap.rb takes a pcap file, strips out duplicate packets, and
# writes them to a file.
#
# The duplicate pcap problem is common when I'm capturing
# traffic to/from a VMWare image, for some reason.
#
# Currently, the timestamp information is lost due to PcapRub's
# file read. For me, this isn't a big deal. Future versions
# will deal with timestamps correctly.
require './examples' # For path setting slight-of-hand
