= Changelog

== Version x # In the future
	Added .is_proto? functions, self.proto function, Packet.headers attr_accessor across the board.
	Removed dependency on pcaprub to read pcap-formatted files. (r54)
	Added ability to preserve timestamps when reading files using :keep_ts => true argument on Read#f2a and Write honors both saved timestamp or invented timestamps. (r55)
  Various minor bugs. (r56)
	Relaxed the requirement for PcapRub to 0.7-dev now that I handle packet reading on my own. Windows users and threading will be broke without 0.8-dev, though. (r57)
	Endianness of pcap files (for both reading and writing) is now supported (r58).
	Handle non-version-4 IP packets correctlier (r59) (thanks tmanning!).
