    # A note on the :strip => true argument: If :strip is set, defined lengths of data will
    # be believed, and any trailers (such as frame check sequences) will be chopped off. This
    # helps to ensure well-formed packets, at the cost of losing perhaps important FCS data.
    # 
    # If :strip is false, header lengths are /not/ believed, and all data will be piped in.
    # When capturing from the wire, this is usually fine, but recalculating the length before
    # saving or re-transmitting will absolutely change the data payload; FCS data will become
    # part of the TCP data as far as tcp_len is concerned. Some effort has been made to preserve
    # the "real" payload for the purposes of checksums, but currently, it's impossible to seperate
    # new payload data from old trailers, so things like pkt.payload += "some data" will not work
    # correctly.

    # So, to summarize; if you intend to alter the data, use :strip. If you don't, don't. Also,
    # this is a horrid hack. Stripping is useful (and fun!), but the default behavior really
    # should be to create payloads correctly, and /not/ treat extra FCS data as a payload.
    #
    # Finally, packet subclasses should take two arguments: the string that is the data
    # to be transmuted into a packet, as well as args. This superclass method is merely
